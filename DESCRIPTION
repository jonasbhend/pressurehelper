Title: Convert historical air pressure records
Version: 1.0
Authors@R: 'Jonas Bhend <jonas.bhend@gmx.ch> [aut, cre]'
Description: A collection of functions to convert historical records of
    atmospheric pressure and temperature to a common data format. These
    conversions include the estimation of observation times from qualitative
    information (e.g. sunset), the conversion of non-SI length units used in
    barometer readings, the conversion of non-SI temperature readings and the
    extraction of climatological temperature from 20CR for a given observation
    date and location.
